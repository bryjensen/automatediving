    what is constant
    what is variable
    adjustments from outside set parameters, how to teach that 
    the machine_learing will have a specific range to maintain with a variance to work with
    setting new functions for distance from allowables, 
    r0 is the function and r1 is the first distance to give directions about
    twelve point two is ok but twelve point three is not so in order to maintain which steps are to be taken 
    a balance between action and time for the reaction
